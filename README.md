# Getting started with Pydantic

Pydantic is Python’s most popular data validation library that can turn type hints into runtime validation rules.

Instead of writing dozens of if isinstance() checks and custom validation functions, you define your data structure once using familiar Python syntax.

Pydantic handles the rest: validating incoming data, converting types when appropriate, and providing clear error messages when validation fails.


Pydantic works best when you’re building APIs, processing external data, managing configuration, or any scenario where data validation failure should be caught early rather than causing mysterious bugs later. It converts runtime errors into clear, actionable validation messages that help both developers and users understand what went wrong.
