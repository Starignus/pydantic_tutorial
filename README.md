# Getting started with Pydantic

Pydantic is Python’s most popular data validation library that can turn type hints into runtime validation rules.

Instead of writing dozens of if isinstance() checks and custom validation functions, you define your data structure once using familiar Python syntax.

Pydantic handles the rest: validating incoming data, converting types when appropriate, and providing clear error messages when validation fails.

Pydantic works best when you’re building APIs, processing external data, managing configuration, or any scenario where data validation failure should be 
caught early rather than causing mysterious bugs later. It converts runtime errors into clear, actionable validation messages that help both developers 
and users understand what went wrong.


# BaseModel vs. data classes
Understanding when to use Pydantic’s BaseModel versus Python's @dataclass helps you choose the right tool for each situation.

* Use **dataclasses** for internal data structures, configuration objects, or when performance is critical and you trust your data sources
* Use **Pydantic** for API endpoints, user input, external data parsing, or when you need JSON serialisation

Pydantic adds some overhead compared to dataclasses, but this cost is usually negligible compared to the bugs it prevents and the development time 
it saves. For web applications, the automatic integration with frameworks like FastAPI makes Pydantic the clear choice.

The validation and serialisation features become more valuable as your application grows. Starting with Pydantic models gives you a solid foundation 
that scales with your needs.
