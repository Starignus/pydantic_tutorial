Exercise

First:

We need to create a Book model which has:

Required title (string, 1-100 chars)
Required author (string)
Optional isbn
price (positive float â‰¤1000)
in_stock (boolean, default True)

Note: ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is normally exactly 13 digits, so to be able to
include that in our class, we would need to use regex expressions.

These regex expressions provide constraints. In this example, we would have to define ISBN as:

isbn: str = Field(default = None, regex=r"^\d{13}$")
However, this is beyond the scope of this tutorial, as it requires prior knowledge of regular expressions (regex).

There is another way to do this, though.

Second:
Validation is one of the biggest reasons we use Pydantic. We will explore it in this section.
https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validators/

@model_validator is used when we want to:

- Validate multiple fields together
- To perform logic that involves the whole model
- Run code before or after normal field validation

@model_validator has 2 options:

1. before - before validation
2. after - after validation

Before (Data still might be wrong) --> Object Installation and Validation --> After (Data is clean and correct)

Example:
class User(BaseModel):
    age: int

User(age="25")
Before validation: age is "25" --> still a string
After validation: age is 25 --> now an integer
